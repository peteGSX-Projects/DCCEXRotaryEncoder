# DCC-EX Rotary Encoder

This software has been written to enable an Arduino with a rotary encoder connected to it to be integrated with a DCC-EX CommandStation.

The primary purpose is to select a position for a turntable via EX-RAIL automation, however it could be used for other purposes.

There is support to use an SPI connected display; either a monochrome OLED, or GC9A01 round colour LCD are supported options.

For the full documentation refer to my [GitHub Project pages](https://petegsx-projects.github.io/rotary-encoder/index.html).

## Software Required

In addition to this software running on an Arduino, you will also need a DCC-EX CommandStation running the official Development branch.

Refer to the official [DCC-EX documentation](https://dcc-ex.com/download/ex-commandstation.html#latest-ex-commandstation-unreleased-development-version) to obtain the correct version.
